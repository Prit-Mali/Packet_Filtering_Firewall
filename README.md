This project is a real-time packet filtering firewall built in C on Linux. It uses libpcap to capture network packets and applies dynamic filtering rules for IP addresses, ports, and protocols. Duplicate packets are detected and skipped using a hash-based approach, improving performance. Ideal for understanding network traffic monitoring, firewall logic, and system-level programming.
